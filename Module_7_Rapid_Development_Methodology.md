# Module 7: Rapid Development Methodology

## üß± Module Purpose
To convert validated plans and designs into working AI agent prototypes using development pathways tailored to project complexity and team maturity. This module operationalizes previous planning by offering three structured development tracks‚ÄîRapid Prototyping, Standard Iterative, and Enterprise Waterfall‚Äîeach with workflows, milestones, and tools to bring agents to life quickly and reliably.

## üîç Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Track Selection Matrix
Determine the right development approach based on:
- Team size and technical skill
- Project scope and urgency
- Risk tolerance and compliance needs

---

### 2. Rapid Prototyping Track (Day 1/Day 2)
**Day 1:**
- Finalize MVP use case and success criteria
- Configure no-code/low-code tool (Zapier, AI Builder, AutoGen Studio)
- Import prompt templates and data connections

**Day 2:**
- Build working prototype with core features
- Run test data or real user walkthroughs
- Collect feedback and iterate

> Target: Functional prototype in <48 hours

---

### 3. Standard Iterative Track (Agile)
Weekly sprint model with:
- Monday: Sprint planning and task scoping
- Mid-week: Dev and user testing check-ins
- Friday: Review demo, collect feedback, log changes

> Ideal for startups or teams building iteratively  
> Supports plug-in use of LangChain, LlamaIndex, Streamlit

---

### 4. Enterprise Waterfall Track
Structured documentation-driven build process:
- Predefined phases: Requirements > Architecture > Data Prep > Dev > QA > UAT
- Formal stakeholder signoffs and compliance checkpoints
- Tool integration via enterprise orchestration platforms

> For regulated or long-cycle enterprise builds

---

### 5. Toolchain Planning Guide
Match tools to your chosen track:
- **No-Code**: Zapier, AI Builder, AutoGen Studio, Rivet
- **Low-Code/Code**: LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Streamlit, Flask, VS Code
- **Agile Support**: Jira, Notion, Trello, Slack
- **Versioning & DevOps**: Git, DVC, MLflow, CI/CD pipelines

---

### 6. Version Control & Reproducibility
- Use Git-based workflows with commit tagging
- Store prompts and config files (JSON/YAML)
- Track model changes and API versions

> Source: Gemini MLOps best practices

---

### 7. User Testing & Feedback Integration
- Lightweight feedback forms (Google Forms, Typeform)
- UAT protocols for iterative builds
- Feedback-to-iteration pipelines with tracking labels

---

## üìà Success Metrics

- Time to First Working Prototype
- Sprint Completion Rate (Standard Track)
- UAT Acceptance Rate
- Rework Frequency (indicator of planning mismatch)
- User Feedback Satisfaction Score

---

## üõ† Tool & Integration Suggestions

- **No-Code**: AutoGen Studio, Microsoft AI Builder, Zapier, Rivet
- **Dev Frameworks**: LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- **Agile Tools**: Jira, Notion, Trello
- **Testing**: LangSmith, Promptfoo
- **Versioning**: Git, DVC, MLflow

---

## üì¶ Reusable Templates Included

- Track Selection Matrix
- Day 1/Day 2 Planning Sheet
- Sprint Planning Board Template
- Waterfall Build Milestone Checklist
- Dev Toolchain Selector
- Version Control Logging Template
- Feedback-to-Iteration Workflow Map

## üîÑ Development Tracks Mapping

| Track | Flow | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Weekend Warrior** | Day 1/Day 2 build + user test + iterate | Working MVP agent in 48 hours |
| **Startup** | 2-week sprints, modular builds + feedback | Iterative prototype with active testing |
| **Enterprise** | Fully documented build lifecycle | Audit-ready agent pipeline with stakeholder sign-off |
