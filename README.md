## 🗺️ How to Use This Framework

This repository is structured into **11 standalone but interlinked modules**. You can:

- **Start from the top** if you're planning a full agent lifecycle (recommended).
- **Drop into a specific module** (e.g., risk management or deployment) if you’re enhancing existing systems.
- **Follow your track** — Each module supports **Weekend Warrior**, **Startup**, and **Enterprise** paths depending on your stage and scale.

Navigation options:
- Each module lives in its own `.md` file.
- Every module includes success metrics, templates, and tool suggestions.
- Dependency links help you know what comes before and after each step.
