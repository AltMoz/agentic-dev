# Module 2: Project Selection Framework

## 🧱 Module Purpose
To filter discovered AI opportunities from Module 1 through a structured decision-making process. This ensures selected projects are feasible, valuable, and strategically aligned with the organization’s goals, avoiding wasted effort and aligning technical efforts with high-impact outcomes.

---

## 🔍 Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Feasibility Scoring Matrix
Evaluate opportunities on four weighted criteria:
- **Data Availability** (30%)
- **Technical Complexity** (25%)
- **User Access for Testing** (20%)
- **Value Potential** (25%)

Each is scored on a 1–10 scale, with weighted averages used for comparison and ranking.

> From original framework draft + Perplexity FW1 + Gemini research

---

### 2. Build-vs-Buy-vs-Wait Decision Matrix
A structured guide to determine the right path:
- **Build**: High value + feasible with internal tools/skills + no strong existing solution
- **Buy**: High value + not feasible internally + good external options exist
- **Wait**: High potential but current constraints (technical/legal/data) suggest deferring

> Adapted from Module 2 detailed guidance in Perplexity FW1 and Agentic Framework.txt

---

### 3. Value Assessment Rubric
Quantify the potential business impact:
- **Time Savings** (hours saved/week or FTE impact)
- **Revenue Impact** (direct or indirect)
- **Learning Value** (team capability growth)
- **Strategic Differentiation** (market positioning)

> Informed by Gemini ROI models and Google KPI evaluation strategies

---

### 4. Project Viability Summary Template
A one-page summary template to evaluate:
- Feasibility score + value score
- Initial build-vs-buy recommendation
- Required inputs and missing components
- Stakeholder alignment level
- Risk notes (if early known)

> Final output of Module 2 that flows into Module 3 validation work

### 5. Resource Estimation Framework
Benchmarks based on project complexity:
| Project Type         | Cost Estimate       | Timeline     | Team Size     | Skill Level         |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Simple Agent         | $5K–$50K            | 1–2 months   | 1–2 people     | Basic scripting      |
| Startup MVP          | $50K–$150K          | 2–4 months   | 2–4 people     | ML familiarity       |
| Enterprise Solution  | $400K–$1M+          | 6–12 months  | 8–15 people    | Full AI/ML team      |

> Based on Perplexity’s market research and real-world resource benchmarking
