Agentic AI Development Framework v3
Core Modules (11 Components)

Opportunity Discovery - Systematic brainstorming to identify AI-suitable problems through personal pain point analysis, industry research, and opportunity pattern recognition. Includes problem inventory worksheets and "AI opportunity spotting" frameworks.
Project Selection Framework - Filters discovered opportunities using feasibility scoring (data availability, technical complexity, user access), value assessment (time savings, revenue impact), and resource estimation. Includes build-vs-buy-vs-wait decision matrices.
Purpose & Opportunity Validation - Validates selected project through needs analysis, competitive landscape review, and ROI potential mapping. Confirms project viability before technical planning begins.
Technical Architecture Planning - Maps system requirements, selects optimal tech stack (API-first, cloud services, integration points), defines data flow patterns, and establishes scalability constraints. Covers both no-code and full development paths.
Data & Knowledge Strategy - Structures information requirements into two tracks: Data Strategy (sources, quality, pipelines) and Capability Boundaries (what the agent should/shouldn't attempt, failure modes, escalation triggers).
Interaction Design Framework - Defines comprehensive user experience including conversation flows, error handling, personality/tone, multi-modal interfaces, and user onboarding sequences. Emphasizes natural language optimization.
Rapid Development Methodology - Provides three development tracks:

Rapid Prototyping Track: Compresses planning into Day 1, Day 2 building minimal viable agent
Standard Iterative: Weekly sprints with user testing cycles
Enterprise Waterfall: Full documentation and approval gates


Performance Evaluation System - Establishes quantitative metrics (response accuracy, latency, user satisfaction) and qualitative assessments (conversation quality, edge case handling). Includes A/B testing frameworks and continuous monitoring.
Integration & Deployment Planning - Handles system connections (APIs, databases, third-party tools), scaling strategies, production environment setup, and maintenance protocols.
Risk Management & Ethics - Addresses safety through specific checklists: hallucination detection, bias auditing, privacy controls, data security, compliance requirements, and user harm prevention.
Evolution & Maintenance Protocol - Manages version control, feature updates, learning integration from user interactions, performance optimization, and long-term sustainability planning.

Flow Patterns & Interactions
Three Primary Development Paths:
Weekend Warrior Track: Discovery → Selection → Validation → Data Strategy → Rapid Prototyping → Basic Performance → Quick Deploy (48-72 hours total)
Standard Development: Full sequential flow with feedback loops between Evaluation and all earlier modules
Enterprise Track: Risk-first approach with Architecture and Risk Assessment running parallel from start
Weekend Warrior Track (Enhanced)
Day 1 - Discovery & Foundation (6-8 hours):
Hour 0.5: Problem Brainstorming Session

"Daily frustrations" inventory using structured worksheet
"Repetitive tasks" identification exercise
"Information gaps" mapping in work/personal life

Hour 1: Opportunity Filtering

Apply "AI suitability" checklist to brainstormed problems
Generate 3-5 viable project candidates using opportunity templates
Quick competitive scan: "Does this already exist?"

Hour 1.5: Project Selection

Score candidates using feasibility rubric (1-10 scale):

Data availability (can I get the info the AI needs?)
Technical complexity (can I build this with available tools?)
User access (can I test this with real users?)
Value potential (time savings, revenue impact, learning value)


Select final project using decision matrix

Hour 2: Purpose Validation

Define success criteria: "What does 'working' look like?"
Identify 3-5 core use cases the AI must handle
Estimate resource requirements and timeline

Hour 3-4: Data Strategy Workshop

Map information sources needed for core use cases
Identify 3-5 primary data feeds or knowledge bases
Define capability boundaries: what should the AI NOT attempt?

Hour 5-6: Interaction Design Sketching

Map 5 primary conversation flows
Design error handling and escalation paths
Define AI personality/tone for target users

Day 2 - Build & Test (6-8 hours):

Hour 1-2: Set up no-code automation platform
Hour 3-5: Build core agent functionality with basic prompts
Hour 6-7: Integration testing with real data sources
Hour 8: User testing with 3-5 target users, immediate iteration

Enhanced Module 1 & 2 Detail
Module 1: Opportunity Discovery
Personal Problem Inventory Worksheet:

Daily task analysis: "What do I do repeatedly that feels mechanical?"
Information bottlenecks: "Where do I waste time finding answers?"
Decision support gaps: "Where do I need better data to choose?"
Communication inefficiencies: "What explanations do I give over and over?"

AI Opportunity Pattern Recognition:

Pattern matching: Tasks with clear inputs/outputs
Information synthesis: Combining data from multiple sources
Personalization: Adapting responses to user context
Availability: 24/7 access to expertise or assistance
Scale: Handling volume that overwhelms humans

Industry Research Templates:

Competitor AI analysis: What are others building?
Industry pain point research: What problems are underserved?
Emerging technology scanning: What new capabilities enable new solutions?

Module 2: Project Selection Framework
Feasibility Scoring Rubric (1-10 scale):
Data Availability (Weight: 30%)

1-3: Requires proprietary/hard-to-access data
4-6: Needs some custom data collection or processing
7-8: Mostly uses public APIs or easily accessible sources
9-10: Uses readily available data (web, documents, APIs)

Technical Complexity (Weight: 25%)

1-3: Requires custom AI model training or advanced programming
4-6: Needs moderate integration work or custom development
7-8: Can be built with existing tools and basic customization
9-10: Can be built with no-code tools and templates

User Access for Testing (Weight: 20%)

1-3: Hard to find users willing to test
4-6: Limited user access or testing opportunities
7-8: Easy access to friendly testers
9-10: You are the primary user (can test extensively)

Value Potential (Weight: 25%)

Time savings estimate (hours per week)
Revenue impact potential (direct or indirect)
Learning value (skills/knowledge gained)
Strategic advantage (competitive positioning)

Build vs. Buy vs. Wait Decision Matrix:

Build: High value + feasible with current skills/tools + no good existing solutions
