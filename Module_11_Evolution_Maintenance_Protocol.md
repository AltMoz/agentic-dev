# Module 11: Evolution & Maintenance Protocol

## 🧱 Module Purpose
To ensure long-term sustainability, relevance, and performance of deployed AI agents through structured maintenance practices, version control, user-informed updates, and continuous learning. This module formalizes how systems evolve post-deployment and ties together all monitoring, feedback, and ethical guardrails from previous modules.

## 🔍 Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Version Control & Change Management
- Semantic versioning strategy (e.g., 1.2.4 → 2.0)
- Feature change logs and documentation updates
- Deprecation and rollback plans

> Tools: Git + changelog automation, DVC, MLflow model tracking

---

### 2. Scheduled Review Cadence
Establish timelines for structured reviews:
- Weekly patch cycles (minor config or prompt updates)
- Monthly performance & risk audits
- Quarterly strategic planning and feature roadmaps

> Source: Gemini MLOps patterns + AI governance cycles

---

### 3. Trigger-Based Maintenance Protocols
React to key events with defined update procedures:
- Drift detected (Module 8)
- User harm or escalation patterns (Module 10)
- Major system integration or data pipeline changes

> Tool integration: LangSmith alerts, CI/CD hooks, audit logs

---

### 4. Feedback-Driven Learning & Iteration
Process incoming data for continuous learning:
- Prompt and template optimization
- New workflows and retraining triggers
- Relevance tuning (RAG scoring)

> Source: CrewAI / LangChain / Gemini prompt evolution models

---

### 5. Knowledge & Data Base Refresh Strategy
- Document re-chunking and re-embedding cadence
- Archiving stale data
- Refreshing external integrations (APIs, websites)

> Tools: LlamaIndex re-indexing, retrieval health reports

---

### 6. Community Engagement & External Input
- Collect feature ideas, bugs, and edge cases from real users
- Open roadmap or feedback board (e.g., Canny, GitHub Discussions)
- User documentation and changelog transparency

---

### 7. Long-Term Maintenance Planning
- Cost forecasting for infrastructure and updates
- Agent lifecycle and end-of-life guidelines
- SLA enforcement and contract renewals (for enterprise)

> Aligns with business continuity and governance strategy

---
