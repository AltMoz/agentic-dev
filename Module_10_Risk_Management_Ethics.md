# Module 10: Risk Management & Ethics

## 🧱 Module Purpose
To proactively identify, mitigate, and manage the ethical, security, and regulatory risks associated with AI agent deployment. This includes implementing frameworks for hallucination detection, bias auditing, privacy protection, compliance enforcement, and user harm prevention. Building on the deployed infrastructure and observability systems in Module 9, this module ensures trust, accountability, and long-term viability in agent operations.

## 🔍 Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Risk Matrix & Categorization Framework
Identify and classify risks across:
- Technical risks (hallucination, model drift)
- Human interaction risks (misuse, overtrust)
- Regulatory risks (non-compliance, data leakage)
- Organizational risks (reputational harm, integration failure)

---

### 2. Hallucination Detection & Response
Implement tools and practices for:
- Confidence thresholding
- Response validation (via RAG or rules)
- Human escalation triggers
- Logging of unverified claims

> Tools: LangChain validation chains, response scoring, retrieval cross-checking

---

### 3. Bias Detection & Mitigation
- Bias audit logs across gender, race, etc.
- Adversarial test cases
- Inclusive prompt patterns and dataset checks

> Tools: IBM AI Fairness 360, Fairlearn, OpenAI Bias Audit Templates

---

### 4. Privacy & User Safety Controls
- PII redaction in inputs/outputs
- Input filtering and rate limiting
- Guardrails for restricted content, unsafe use cases

> Tools: Presidio (Microsoft), Google Perspective API, Regex filters, input sanitizers

---

### 5. Compliance Alignment & Regulatory Templates
- GDPR/CCPA checklists
- SOC 2 and HIPAA coverage maps
- Consent tracking for data ingestion

> Tools: Microsoft Purview, AWS Artifact, TrustArc, OneTrust

---

### 6. Incident Response Protocols
Standardized procedures for:
- Detection and severity classification
- Containment, remediation, and rollback
- Post-incident root cause analysis (RCA)

> Templates: Slack alerts, on-call rotation, audit trail logging

---

### 7. Ethical AI Design Guidelines
Operationalize core ethical principles:
- Accuracy & Reliability
- Accountability & Transparency
- Fairness & Human-Centricity
- Safety & Resilience
- Privacy-Enhancement
- Interpretability & Documentation
