# Day 1 â€“ Setup Guide

## ðŸ”§ Step 1: Pick a Starter
Choose an example folder from `/examples`. We suggest `email-automation-starter`.

## ðŸ§  Step 2: Define the Agent
- What's the problem you're solving?
- Who will use it?
- What should the agent say/do?

## ðŸª„ Step 3: Customize Prompts
Edit the `prompt-template.md` to fit your tone and use case.

## ðŸ”Œ Step 4: Integrate
Use Zapier or Make.com to connect the pieces. The starter folders help!

## âœ… Final Step: Run It
Trigger your automation. If it works once, you can improve it later.
