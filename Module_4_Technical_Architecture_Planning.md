# Module 4: Technical Architecture Planning

## 🧱 Module Purpose
To define the technical blueprint for building the validated AI agent. This includes mapping system requirements, choosing the optimal technology stack, planning for scalability, and ensuring secure, maintainable integrations. The architecture must accommodate both rapid prototyping and enterprise-grade deployment pathways.

## 🔍 Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. System Requirements Mapping
Outline the functional and non-functional requirements:
- Core use cases and interactions
- Performance benchmarks (latency, availability)
- Compliance and security requirements

> Source: Gemini Module 4 enhancement notes + RAND infrastructure planning

---

### 2. Tech Stack Decision Matrix
Guide users through selecting the right platforms:
- API-first design or native integrations
- Cloud provider alignment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Front-end/back-end tools (low-code options, serverless frameworks)

> Template: Visual decision trees + build-vs-buy recommendations

---

### 3. Data Flow & Integration Architecture
Define how the agent will interact with:
- Internal data systems (e.g., CRMs, ticketing tools)
- External APIs and tools
- Vector stores and knowledge bases (for RAG)

> Source: Perplexity research on integration patterns + LangChain stack references

---

### 4. No-Code/Low-Code vs. Full Development Paths
Provide architecture pathways based on complexity:
- **No-Code Path**: AI Builder, AutoGen Studio, Zapier, Rivet
- **Low-Code/Code Path**: LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Flask/Streamlit, Azure/AWS pipelines

> From Gemini’s Rapid Prototyping and Enterprise mode differentiation

---

### 5. Scalability Planning & Constraints
Prepare for scale from the start:
- Load testing benchmarks
- Stateless vs. stateful design (LangGraph, serverless)
- Auto-scaling and failover planning

> Tools: Locust, K6, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, LangGraph state nodes

---

### 6. Security & Compliance Layer
Architect secure and compliant systems:
- OAuth2, JWT-based access
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Region-aware deployment for data sovereignty (EU, US, etc.)

> Reference: MLOps & Enterprise Architecture Best Practices

---

### 7. Architecture Blueprint Template
Standardized diagram + config doc including:
- Components (data sources, vector DBs, APIs)
- Interactions and permissions
- Hosting model (cloud, hybrid, on-prem)

## 🔄 Development Tracks Mapping

| Track | Flow | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Weekend Warrior** | Use No-Code path + auto-generated architecture template | Deployed agent in <1 week using low-friction stack |
| **Startup** | Mix of low-code tools + 3rd-party integrations | Working MVP stack with known constraints |
| **Enterprise** | Full decision tree + review checkpoints + secure cloud deployment | Architected system ready for compliance and scale |
