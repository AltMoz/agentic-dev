### 💡 Tool Comparison Matrix (Sample)

| Tool | Category | Cost | Ideal Track | Alternatives |
|------|----------|------|-------------|--------------|
| LlamaIndex | Data/RAG | Free–$$ | All | LangChain loaders |
| Zapier | No-Code Dev | $20+/mo | Weekend Warrior | n8n (open source) |
| LangSmith | Eval & Debug | Free–Pro | Startup, Enterprise | Promptfoo, MLflow |
| Microsoft Purview | Compliance | $$$ | Enterprise | AWS Lake Formation |
| Streamlit | UI & App | Free | All | Flask, Gradio |

---

### 🧰 Platform-Specific Notes

- **AWS**: Use Bedrock Agents, S3, Lambda, Terraform for serverless setups.
- **Azure**: Use Azure AI Studio, Microsoft AI Builder, Azure DevOps.
- **GCP**: Use Vertex AI, BigQuery, and Cloud Run for microservice orchestration.
- **On-Prem**: Favor containerized deployment (Docker + K8s), self-hosted vector DBs (FAISS, Chroma).

## 2. 📊 Framework Assessment Rubric

### ✅ Module Completion Criteria

| Module | Completion Criteria |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Documented opportunity list + ROI mapping |
| 2 | Weighted scorecard + project decision matrix |
| 3 | Persona + validation brief with ROI logic |
| 4 | Blueprint + stack decision + data flow map |
| 5 | Data inventory + readiness scores + governance sheet |
| 6 | UX flow, tone spec, fallback logic, HITL plan |
| 7 | Agent prototype + sprint logs or checklist |
| 8 | Metrics defined + dashboard/mock + test results |
| 9 | Deployment checklist + CI/CD flow + SLA target |
| 10 | Risk matrix + ethics checklist + IR playbook |
| 11 | Version log + maintenance calendar + feedback system |

---

### 📈 Scoring System

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Fully complete with verified outputs and stakeholder sign-off |
| 4 | Mostly complete with minor gaps |
| 3 | Drafted outputs but missing validation or connection |
| 2 | Outputs incomplete or theoretical only |
| 1 | Not started or unclear progress |

Use for each module to produce a total score (out of 55).  

> ✅ 45–55: Excellent implementation  
> ⚠️ 30–44: Review needed—gaps in planning or testing  
> ❌ <30: High risk—pause and rebuild foundational elements

---

### 🔍 Gap Identification Prompts

- Are outputs documented and reusable?
- Were real users or stakeholders involved?
- Are module handoffs working across dependencies?
- Are compliance/privacy/risk checks integrated or siloed?

---

### 📈 Success Benchmarks (By Track)

| Track | Benchmark |
|-------|-----------|
| Weekend Warrior | MVP in 48–72 hrs, covers 5+ modules |
| Startup | Validated agent with 8+ modules, A/B test run |
| Enterprise | Full lifecycle execution, SLA and governance protocols in place |

---

## 3. 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### ⚠️ Common Framework Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Vague opportunity with low ROI | Re-run Module 1 + 2 scoring and match to Module 3 personas |
| Agent fails in test but not in prototype | Revisit prompt engineering in Module 6 and test cases in Module 8 |
| Data not retrievable in production | Audit Module 5 pipeline and re-index via Module 11 |
| No user adoption | Revise onboarding flow (Module 6) and clarify agent value in Module 3 |

---

### 🔄 Iterate or Proceed?

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Missing outputs or skipped module | 🛑 Go back and complete it |
| Users unclear on value | 🔁 Revisit validation and onboarding |
| Feedback loop inactive | 🔁 Implement Module 8 and 11 feedback cycle |
| Architecture errors in deployment | 🛑 Rerun Module 4 and verify inputs from Module 3/5 |
