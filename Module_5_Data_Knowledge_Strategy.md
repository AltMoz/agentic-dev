# Module 5: Data & Knowledge Strategy

## 🧱 Module Purpose
To define the data infrastructure and informational boundaries for the AI agent. This includes identifying and structuring data sources, ensuring data quality and compliance, and explicitly stating what the agent should and should not attempt. A robust data strategy is foundational for agent reliability, accuracy, and trust.

## 🔍 Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Data Source Inventory
Document all data sources needed for core agent functionality:
- Internal systems (CRM, support platforms, databases)
- External APIs and public datasets
- File/document repositories (PDFs, Google Drive, SharePoint)

> Source: Gemini + Perplexity data readiness assessments

---

### 2. Data Readiness Framework
Assess the quality, availability, and compliance of each data source:
- Freshness and update frequency
- Access controls and authentication
- Sensitivity and compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

> Tools: Schema validation, null value scans, privacy scoring

---

### 3. Data Pipeline Design
Plan how data will be ingested, transformed, and fed to the agent:
- ETL/ELT pipelines
- Chunking for RAG (text splitting, embedding)
- Live vs. batch updates

> Tools: LlamaIndex, LangChain, Airbyte, Prefect

---

### 4. Knowledge Indexing Strategy
Decide how information will be structured and queried:
- Vector stores (Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate)
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Metadata tagging and filters

> Critical for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

### 5. Capability Boundaries Definition
Define what the agent should NOT attempt:
- Unsupported data types (e.g., image/video if not configured)
- Domains outside scope
- Escalation paths for ambiguous or risky requests

> Ensures safe, reliable, and explainable behavior

---

### 6. Failure Mode Analysis & Escalation Triggers
Prepare for edge cases and system errors:
- What happens if data is missing?
- When does the agent escalate to a human?
- What fallback messages are used?

---

### 7. Data Governance & Compliance Planning
Ensure data handling aligns with laws and internal policies:
- Consent handling, PII controls
- Anonymization, retention, audit logs
- Third-party data licensing review
