# Module 6: Interaction Design Framework

## üß± Module Purpose
To define how users will interact with the AI agent across different modalities and contexts. This includes structuring conversations, designing error handling and escalation points, defining tone and personality, and supporting multimodal experiences. Grounded in the data boundaries and failure scenarios defined in Module 5, this module ensures agents are intuitive, trustworthy, and effective.

## üîç Sub-Components & Templates

### 1. Conversation Flow Design
Map typical user-agent dialogues:
- Primary use cases and expected flows
- Branching logic for user inputs
- Handling ambiguous queries

> Tools: flowcharts, decision trees, Miro, Lucidchart  
> Source: Gemini + CrewAI + LangGraph state planning

---

### 2. Tone, Personality & UX Principles
Define consistent user-facing voice:
- Agent ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù template (formal, casual, helpful, expert)
- Language tone guidance (concise vs. verbose, emoji use, etc.)
- Multilingual and accessibility considerations

> Source: User onboarding psychology, GPT persona patterning

---

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Design
Define human intervention points:
- Thresholds for escalation (confidence score, sensitive data)
- Alerting workflows (Slack, email, dashboarding)
- Approval check-ins for regulated flows

> Source: Gemini HITL architecture recommendations

---

### 4. Escalation & Error Handling Logic
Design fallbacks for failed, incomplete, or uncertain interactions:
- Graceful fallback responses
- Triggered escalation to humans or alternative workflows
- Logging for retraining and debugging

> Tools: LangSmith, custom observability tooling

---

### 5. Multi-Modal Interface Planning
Plan user interactions beyond chat:
- Web form + chatbot hybrid UX
- Voice interface or visual annotation (if applicable)
- File uploads (e.g. PDF, CSV) and data ingestion flows

> Source: Gemini multi-modal design strategy

---

### 6. Onboarding & User Education
Structure first-use interactions:
- Welcome message + purpose disclosure
- Agent capabilities and limitations briefing
- Tips, retry guidance, and escalation visibility

> Key for adoption in both startup and enterprise contexts

---

### 7. Prompt Engineering Techniques
Standardize prompt styles and input/output constraints:
- Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought patterns
- Role instruction preambles
- Function-calling and system prompt configuration

## üîÑ Development Tracks Mapping

| Track | Flow | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Weekend Warrior** | Prebuilt tone + minimal flow + fallback | Clean first-use UX with self-contained agent |
| **Startup** | Conversational design + simple escalation + prompt testing | Branded agent with defined tone, working prototype |
| **Enterprise** | Multimodal support + HITL + fallback routing + compliance UI | Trustworthy agent aligned with regulatory and user policies |
